# For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
#   assets:
#     - assets/images/app_logo_splash.png
#     - assets/fonts/Quicksand-Regular.ttf
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
#   fonts:
#     - family: Quicksand
#       fonts:
#         - asset: assets/fonts/Quicksand-Regular.ttf
#         - asset: assets/fonts/Quicksand-Italic
#           style: italic
#     - family: SpaceMono
#       fonts:
#         - asset: assets/fonts/SpaceMono
#         - asset: assets/fonts/SpaceMono-Bold
#           weight: 700

  # For details regarding fonts in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
